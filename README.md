# Python-class-practice


Bank Account
In this project, we'll create a Python class that can be used to create and manipulate a personal bank account.

The bank account class you'll create should have methods for each of the following:

* Accepting deposits
* Allowing withdrawals
* Showing the balance
* Showing the details of the account
